      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Common Issues We See</h2>
      <p>The three most common issues we see are lights not working, broken plugs, and breakers tripping.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Lights Not Working</h2>
      <p>One of the most common calls we get is for lights that have stopped working. Almost always this is just a faulty dimmer switch leading to intermittent or complete loss of function. On the funnier side, you'd be surprised how often we get called out to troubleshoot broken lights only to find out the lightbulbs are burnt out.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Plugs Are Broken Or Not Working</h2>
      <p>Various issues can cause plugs to malfunction, but in the end, the plug usually needs to be replaced. The tricky part is figuring out which plug died. We can usually use a plug tester to find the issue and replace the plug.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Breakers Tripping</h2>
      <p>Frequent breaker trips can be a sign of a more serious electrical issue that need attention. This common problem can be caused by overloaded circuits, short circuits, improperly done electrical work, or rarely faulty appliances. If you can't piece together what is causing the trip based off what you're turning on and off, you should consider calling an electrician to take a look.</p>
