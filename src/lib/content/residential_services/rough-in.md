## What is an Electrical Rough-In?

The electrical rough-in process involves installing all electrical boxes, wiring, and other infrastructure components before the walls are closed with drywall. This is a critical stage in any renovation, as it lays the groundwork for all future electrical elements, including outlets, switches, light fixtures, and appliances.

## Steps Involved in Electrical Rough-In:

**Planning and Design**: Work with a licensed electrician to create a detailed plan that considers all electrical needs for the renovated space. This includes the placement of switches, outlets, light fixtures, and special wiring for high-powered appliances.

**Running Wires**: Route electrical wires through the conduits and secure them to the boxes. This includes wires for power supply and communication cables like ethernet or telephone lines.

**Inspection**: Before the walls are closed up, an inspection by a city building inspector is often required to ensure all installations meet electrical codes and safety standards.
