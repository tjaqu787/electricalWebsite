# Lighting Services

Here are some of the most common types of lighting we offer:

## Outdoor Lighting

Outdoor lighting comes in various shapes and sizes, each offering unique benefits to enhance your home's exterior. Here are some popular options:

## Security Lighting

Security lighting can illuminate darker corners and help you become more aware of any movement outside your home, thanks to motion sensors. Besides improving safety by preventing falls or fumbling in the dark, security lights often come with timers and sensors, typically using floodlights or spotlights.

## Spotlights

Spotlights are versatile, serving both security and decorative purposes. They can highlight features or details in your yard, such as well-trimmed trees, fountains, or sculptures. Place spotlights at the base of structures or trees, or behind important features to create a stunning silhouette effect.
