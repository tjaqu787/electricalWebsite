## Common Issues We See
The three most common issues we see are lights not working, broken plugs, and breakers tripping.
## Lights Not Working

One of the most common issues homeowners face when their lights stop working is faulty switches. Switches can wear out or become loose, leading to intermittent or complete loss of function. On the funnier side, you'd be surprised how often we get called out to troubleshoot broken lights only to find out the lightbulbs are burnt out.

## Plugs Are Broken Or Not Working

Various issues can cause plugs to malfunction, but in the end, the plug usually needs to be replaced. Broken or non-functional plugs can be a significant inconvenience and a potential safety hazard in any home.

## Breakers Tripping

Frequent breaker trips can be a sign of underlying electrical issues that need attention. This common problem can be caused by overloaded circuits, short circuits, or faulty appliances. If you can't piece together what is causing the trip, you should consider calling an electrician to take a look.
